Neural Processing Letters (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11063-021-10680-x", availbale at: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-021-10680-x. it is also available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04039.
  
You need to install Cupy package to work with GPU. You can install it on your own machine by the following command:

`$ sudo pip install cupy`

The pre-trained wight matrices of the first and second layers are respectively available in W0_binary.npy and W1_binary.npy files.
